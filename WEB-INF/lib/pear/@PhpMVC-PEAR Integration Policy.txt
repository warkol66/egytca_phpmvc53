
PROPOSED Php.MVC/PEAR Integration Policy

A) Bundled PEAR libs (developer convenience only)
	We load all necessary classes (global prepend)
	Comment-out all bundled PEAR include/require statements


B) External PEAR libs (recommended for production servers)
	Developers maintain external libraries as required
	Developer may need to set the path to the External PEAR libs
	in the php.ini or global_paths or app_level_paths.

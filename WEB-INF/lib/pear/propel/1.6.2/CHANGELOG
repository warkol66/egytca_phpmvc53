# Changelog Of The Propel 1.6 Branch #

## 2011-09-14: Version 1.6.2 ##

* [cb2009a] [delegate behavior] Fix incorrect handling of tablePrefix Refs #63.
* [9aef5f6] [i18n] Added few tests to prove there is no bug with relations.
* [4cf9dc7] Fixed #93
* [65139a1] [PropelSQLTask] Fixed SQL filenames
* [b27fef5] Revert "Fixed possibility issue on SQL filenames based on package values"

* [bffd323] Fixed failing unit tests complaining about an "Undefined index: datasources" when running some tests individually
* [6a0e030] Fixed version column needs to be required for mssql. The `versionable` behavior adds the version table by copying the main table, which already contains the version column. The problem is, as the version column becomes part of the PK of the version table, it must be required. Only MSSQL seems to complay about this, but it must be fixed anyway.

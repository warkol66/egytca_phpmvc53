These tests are taken directly from the FFMPEG-PHP module. So theoretically
if the adapter works exactly as required none of these tests shall fail.
NOTE: these tests are redistributed under the original FFMPEG-PHP modules GPL

NOTE: The all the tests, inc test_phpvideotoolkit.php have been altered slightly
to fit this classes example layout and class structure.
